Methanol, known as“clean coal,”\"cheap oil,”“mobile electricity,”and “liquid hydrogen,”finds extensive application across industries, from chemicals to energy[1].G.A. Olah's[2] proposition of the “Methanol economy”anticipates its heightened prominence in the coming years,potentially ushering ina new fuel era.Currently,global methanol demand has doubled in the past decade,reaching 1O7 million tons[3].With a 99.47 million-ton production capacity in 2022—an $8 . 8 4 \\%$ increase from the previous year—China leads the world methanol industry in terms of new production capacity.In the same year, China's methanol production reached 8.306 million tons, marking a $6 . 2 7 \\%$ yearon-year rise[4].Methanol demand is still rising,propelled by consistent domestic economic growth and quicker developments in the chemical, electronics,and automotive industries.[5].Data indicates a notable surge in methanol consumption in China,reaching 7.8o8 million tons in apparent consumption in 2021,a $5 . 9 6 \\%$ increase from the previous year [6].This trend intensified in 2022,with apparent methanol consumption hitting 9O million tons,reflecting a $1 5 . 2 6 \\%$ year-on-year rise[7] Methanol,a vital chemical raw material,primarily serves downstream industries like olefins and acetic acid[3].In 2o2l,methanol to olefins accounted for $5 0 . 5 9 \\%$ of demand,followed by methanol fuel at $1 5 . 6 6 \\%$ [8].Diverse technologies presently produce methanol from fossil fuels such as natural gas,coal,crude oil,and biomass[9]. In China,the resource distribution -“more coal, less oil,and less gas\"[4,1O] has historically favored the coal-to-olefins route ( $5 8 \\%$ in 2017),with coal-togas $( 1 7 \\% )$ and natural gas-to-methanol $( 1 4 \\% )$ following suit[11]. Methanol production,characterized by high energy intensity,often leads to environmental challenges[12].For instance,significant emissions of acidic gases (NOx, SOx, $\\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } } )$ and wastewater are commonplace [13] Additionally,gas leakage from various connecting valves during production is prevalent[14]. China's growing environmental focus accentuates the significance of studying the environmental sustainability of the methanol production industry [15]. ","page_number":1},{"text":"Most environmental assessments of methanol production focus on individual technologies or a few specific routes[16].However, there are very few thorough research on the most modern carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol technologies as well as older traditional energy-to-methanol methods.Notably,the Carbon Capture and Utilization (CcU） route's economic and environmental features have attracted a lot of interest[17]. Gonzalez-Garay et al.[18] conducted an exhaustive evaluation of methanol production from carbon dioxide and renewable hydrogen process simulation and lifecycle analysis reveal that green methanol's current cost is 1.3 to 2.6 times higher than conventional fossil-based alternatives,mainly due to hydrogen pricing. Similarly, Perez-Fortes et al.[19] assessed methanol production using hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide,indicating limited carbon emission reduction potential compared to traditional European methods. Cuéllar-Franca et al.[2O] reviewed 27 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies,highlighting CCU's heavy reliance on renewable energy and its associated environmental imbalances. They recommend that entire lifecycle analysis,electrolysis of renewable electricity for hydrogen synthesis,and carbon dioxide purification procedures be included in LCA study for pertinent insights. Thonemann[21] conducted an analysis of LCA-based $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ chemical production, finding no $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ -based technology superior in all impact categories to conventional methods.Methanol production pathways,including biomass gasification and $\\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ recovery from fossil fuel-fired power station flue gases,have been explored by Shamsul et al.[22],addressing bio-methanol's potential as a renewable resource,considering global demand, economic assessment,power density,and potential applications[23]. Zhen et al.[24] describe various methanol production approaches, encompassing coal, natural gas,coke-oven gas,hydrogen,and biomass. Dalena et al.[25] review prevalent feedstocks (natural gas, $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } ,$ coke/ biomass） and methanol production processes,including membrane reactor technology's catalytic conversion of methanol to high-grade hydrogen.Additionally, Blumberg et.Al[26] address methanol synthesis economics with different reforming technologies, evaluating process efficiency for steam reforming,autothermal reforming,and dry methane reforming,along with economic and sensitivity analyses. Gautam et al. present a comprehensive overview of thermo-chemical and biochemical routes for sustainable bio-methanol production from waste biomass. Chen Z et al.[11] conducted a “cradle to gate” life-cycle assessment of COTM (Coal Coking to Methanol),CGTM(Coal Gasification to Methanol),and NGTM(Natural Gas to Methanol),offering a comparison of three traditional technology roadmaps. However, research comparing the LCA of all methanol production routes in China remains a gap in the current body of work.
