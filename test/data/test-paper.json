In the fuel gas system,exhaust gases are either flared or recycled.Waste catalyst is not taken into account when calculating solid waste because the catalyst used in the process has a 3-5 year replacement cycle and stays constant during the production of methanol.Notably,because the post-production processes are the same for all routes,methanol application is not addressed.Figs.3 to 7 show the system boundaries for each of the five methanol production routes (CGTM, COTM,NGTM,BOTM, and CCTM).
