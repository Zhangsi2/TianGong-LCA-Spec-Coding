Because of its high calorific value and specific physical properties, hard coal has a wide range of applications in the industrial and energy fields, such as power generation, steel production, chemical raw materials and so on. The proportion of bituminous coal in hard coal is high, so hard coal is classified as hard coal-bituminous coal classification option.",

Because of its high calorific value and specific physical properties, hard coal has a wide range of applications in the industrial and energy fields, such as power generation, steel production, chemical raw materials and so on. The proportion of bituminous coal in hard coal is high, so hard coal is classified as hard coal-bituminous coal classification option.",

Methane emitted and coal gangue generated are accounted for.

This process is called coking, which is a chemical process of converting coal into coke. Coke has higher fixed carbon content and lower ash and sulfur content, which makes it have better reducibility and structural strength at high temperature. Coke is one of the indispensable raw materials in metallurgical industry because of its high calorific value, less and lasting flame during combustion.",

The process includes utility and cooling demands. COG is produced in previous coking subprocess, and here serves as principal feedstock. All energy, water, and steam demands captured per Table 2 LCI. Primary outputs are methanol (product), low- and medium-pressure steam (co-product), and exhausted gas; byproducts are managed per plant convention (flare, recycle, process heat). Allocations trace process-level burdens as per energy allocation from upstream COG production. Wastewater and emissions correspond to typical plant operation.",

Although crop cultivation is critical for the net carbon balance, it is not separately inventoried here. This process is part of the assessed BOTM route, as shown in Fig. 6 of the source text. Functional unit: 1 t methanol output from integrated BOTM system. Biomass feedstock is staged for thermal gasification with minimal pre-processing, reflecting Chinese operational practice in 2022. Data sources: Table 4, primary article. Supplementary details and process boundaries described in section 2.1 and 3.",

It is obtained from the heavy gas oil cut. It is also used primarily for steam boilers in power plants, aboard ships, and in industrial plants. Fuel oil is a lighter type of oil, or a liquid byproduct of crude oil, used for energy, especially for heating. It falls under two main categories when petroleum is refined: distillate oils, including diesel, and residual oils, which include things like kerosene.",

Depletion of abiotic resources is a disputed impact category in LCA due to different problem definitions and choices regarding parameters and data. The LCA results identified abiotic depletion potential for fossil fuels (ADPF) as key impact indicators.",

Its dry ash-free volatile Vdaf is generally 10 % to 28 %, and the maximum thickness of the resin layer is y ≤ 25mm. Coking coal can produce colloids with good thermal stability when heated, and coke with large lumpiness, less cracks, high crushing strength and wear resistance can be obtained when coking alone.",

It is made by heating coal in a retort to a high temperature ( about 1000 ° C ) and retorting under the condition of isolating air. This process is called coking, which is a chemical process of converting coal into coke. Coke has higher fixed carbon content and lower ash and sulfur content, which makes it have better reducibility and structural strength at high temperature. Coke is one of the indispensable raw materials in metallurgical industry because of its high calorific value, less and lasting flame during combustion.",

Drying coefficient of natural gas, the ratio of methane component content to total hydrocarbon gas (mainly methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane) component content in natural gas. It is closely related to the genesis type and thermal maturity of natural gas. In terms of application, it is related to the classification of natural gas types and economic value, and is an important parameter for natural gas evaluation research.

It is an alternative to reverse osmosis (RO) as a desalinization mechanism. ED is a membrane process utilizing charge-selective membranes and is pressure-based, like RO. The applications employing electrodialysis include desalination, table salt production, wine stabilization, whey demineralization, and pickling bath recovery.",

A battery storage power station is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. Battery storage is the fastest responding dispatchable source of power on electric grids, and it is used to stabilise those grids.",

Methanol was formerly produced by the destructive distillation of wood. It is a nondrinking type of alcohol used to create fuel, solvents, and antifreeze. It is a colorless, volatile, flammable liquid that is poisonous for human consumption. Methanol is a chemical building block for many everyday products and is also a clean energy resource.",

Depending on the conditions used, different proportions of pyrolysis oil, gas, and char are produced. The products of biomass pyrolysis include biochar, bio-oil and gases such as methane and hydrogen. It has received a lot of interest for energy recovery by generating clean fuels, valuable compounds, and advanced materials.",

They may be configured in a series, parallel or a mixture of both to deliver the desired voltage, capacity, or power density. The term battery pack is often used in reference to cordless tools, radio-controlled hobby toys. It is a portable device that stores electrical energy and provides power to mobile devices when needed. It is essentially a collection of individual batteries housed together, creating a single unit capable of delivering power on demand.",
