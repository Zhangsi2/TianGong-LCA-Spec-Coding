System boundaries include raw material extraction, resource inputs, emissions and outputs, but exclude infrastructure, capital goods, and methanol usage. Comprehensive inventories (inputs and outputs) are given for each route. The inventory data was sourced from plant data, national statistics, scholarly literature, and eFootprint LCA software/database. The methodology follows ISO 14040/44 and includes sensitivity analysis and midpoint/end-point LCIA per CML2001 and Eco-indicator 99. Notably, the environmental impact of electricity and steam inputs is a key sensitivity factor. The inventory omits inputs less than 1% by mass (cumulative omission <3%). Wastewater is treated and reused, solid waste is mostly landfilled locally, and waste catalyst is excluded due to long replacement cycle.",

It can be an intermediate distillate fuel containing certain heavy distillate oils for specific purposes.\n\nNote 1: This distillate oil can be used for blending vehicle gas oil, heating oil, and marine distillate fuel.\nNote 2: It refers to atmospheric gas oil (AGO) or vacuum gas oil (VGO) generally within the distillation range of 250Â°C to 500Â°C; VGO is also known as straight-run wax oil.\nNote 3: The once-used term: gas oil.

It is referred to as 'heavy' because its density or specific gravity is higher than that of light crude oil. Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an API gravity less than 20Â°. Heavy oil is a type of crude oil that is different from conventional crude oil insofar as they are much more difficult to recover from the subsurface reservoir.",

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines solid waste as any material that is discarded and not subject to an exclusion or variance, which includes materials that are abandoned, recycled, or inherently waste-like.
