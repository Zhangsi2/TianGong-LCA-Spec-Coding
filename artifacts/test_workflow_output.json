The product system covers extraction of raw materials, coal gasification, syngas purification, methanol synthesis, and methanol distillation. Facility and infrastructure impacts are excluded. Outputs include purified methanol, flue gas, and wastes. Data are based on Chinese plant statistics, national standards, and literature, with completeness ensuring no more than 3% of inputs are cut off for unit process datasets. Methanol use phase is excluded because all compared routes share the same post-gate processes.",

Because of its high calorific value and specific physical properties, hard coal has a wide range of applications in the industrial and energy fields, such as power generation, steel production, chemical raw materials and so on. The proportion of bituminous coal in hard coal is high, so hard coal is classified as hard coal-bituminous coal classification option.",

Biogas, as the name suggests, is the gas in a swamp. The main component of biogas is methane. Biogas is composed of gases such as 50% -80% methane (CH4), 20% -40% carbon dioxide (CO2), 0% -5% nitrogen (N2), less than 1% hydrogen (H2), less than 0.4% oxygen (O2), and 0.1% -3% hydrogen sulfide (H2S).

When the fat coal is heated, a large number of colloids can be produced. The coke produced when coking alone is good in melting, but there are more transverse cracks, and the coke root part has bee coke. The main use of fat coal is coking, and some high-ash and high-sulfur fat coal is also used for power generation. In coking, fat coal usually needs to be mixed with other coals to optimize the quality of coke.",
