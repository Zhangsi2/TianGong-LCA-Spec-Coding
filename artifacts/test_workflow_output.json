Methanol was formerly produced by the destructive distillation of wood. It is a nondrinking type of alcohol used to create fuel, solvents, and antifreeze. It is a colorless, volatile, flammable liquid that is poisonous for human consumption. Methanol is a chemical building block for many everyday products and is also a clean energy resource.",

Educt name for coal gas is typically coal. Moreover, the description implies whether the product is offered within a production mix or as a consumer-ready fuel, and the point of transfer, such as 'to consumer' or 'at plant'.",
